## Go-Source

- [ ] Why is the `unsafe` package called in [system.go](https://github.com/JustinTimperio/xen-guest-tools/blob/master/go-source/system/system.go) and can it be reimplemented in a better way?
- [ ] What does [guestmetric_test.go](https://github.com/JustinTimperio/xen-guest-tools/blob/master/go-source/guestmetric/guestmetric_test.go) and [xenstore_test.go](https://github.com/JustinTimperio/xen-guest-tools/tree/master/go-source/xenstoreclient) test? Can they be move to `/tests` and used in a release test suite?
- [ ] Can the source files be restructured so there are NOT multiple files with the same name?
- [ ] Can the source files be merged into a single core `/go-source` folder?
- [ ] Does the FreeBSD and Alpine forks use different/modified source code?
